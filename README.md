This is the Assignment 1 for the 2014/2015 Software Quality and Dependability class, from the Masters in Software Engineering, in Coimbra's University. 

The purpose of the assignment is to develop a web service based N-Version programming insulin dose calculator for patients with type-2 diabetes. Patients with type-2 diabetes need periodic insulin injections to help process blood sugar. It is critical to be able to provide enough insulin to metabolize the carbohydrates obtained from food, and even more critical to never inject higher doses that may cause hypoglycemia, which may lead to coma and brain damage.

This web application is built on Java, with the framework Struts2.
